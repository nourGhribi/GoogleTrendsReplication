              <h2>What do common shareholders search on Google when they are afraid of the future?</h2>
              
              <p> When people are interested in a given stock, they will google its ticker and related news but also search about the market in general. 
                We can actually know if the market is bullish or bear by looking at this searches. <br>
                <br>
                In the case of the Dow Jones index which measures the stock performance of 30 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States,
                the context is more important. <br>
                <br>
                Here in context of crisis, people will search for words such as <br>
                'debt','loan','job','unemployment','economics','inflation','sell','bonds','gold',
                'stocks','dow jones', 'crisis','finance','risk', or'leverage'. </p>

                <p><br>As we want to make the model simple and the forecasting fast, we only keep the most relevant ones. <br>
                  We did proceed in the following way to select the keywords: <br>
                  First, we kept only the keyword that had a spike just before or during the crisis. <br></p>

                <p>We remove the seasonality from the Google Trends data before using it. We also plot the trends of these time series 
                and the DJI price at the same scale to see clear spikes in volatility right after an increase in the queries volume for the selected keywords. <br>
                Then, from this list, we kept only the significant ones after fitting the trends model.</p>
