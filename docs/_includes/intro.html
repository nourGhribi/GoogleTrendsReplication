              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
               Since our goal is to predict increase in volatility because of a financial crisis, we should analyze an index rather 
               than a particular stock because we just care about the whole market. 
               Also, one stock could be affected by very specific reasons such as earnings report, news, lawsuits etc. <br>
               <br>
               We chose the Dow Jones Industrial Average index given its reputation as a reference for financal market trends in the US. <br>
               We consider this index during the Covid-19 crisis from January until May 2020 and in particular during the stock market crash between
               February 20th and April 7th. <br> 
               <br>
               It has been shown that using Google Trends is particularly efficient during recessions for forecasting near term economic indicators 
               and it is also the case for financial time series. <br>
               <br>
               As a remark, the presented solution can be extrapolated for any stock of your choice with minimum tweaking as well as to other periods! 
               Indeed, we didn't include specific Covid-19 data. <br>
               <br>
               We do not claim any methodological advances here, certainly it is possible to build more sophisticated forecasting models than those we use 
               but we showed how easy it is to use Google Trends to improve basic models.
