                <p class="text-faded">  Who has ever watched movies or documentaries about the 2008 crisis like "The Big Short" or "Inside Job" and wondered
                    "If only I could predict the stock market crisis and make so much money by betting against the market?" 
                    <br>
                    <br> We did. <br>
                    <br>
                    In particular, since the recent Covid-19 crisis, where we saw in barely four trading days a plunge of 26% in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
                    More and more people have started trading on the stock market since then, resulting in an increase in market volatility. <br>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    Thus, one should get interested in people's behavior to be able to predict a stock or index trend.
                    And guess what could be a good insight on what people think? 
                    
                    <br> Their Google searches! <br>
                    
                    <br>
                    
                    This gave us the idea to use Google Trends to improve volatility forecasting models.
                    But first, we need to find out which search terms are relevant and how to use them. </p>
